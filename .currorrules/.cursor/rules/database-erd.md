# 4. SCALABILITY STRATEGY

1. All core tables include organization_id for tenant isolation.
2. UUID primary keys for distributed scaling.
3. Index heavily on:
   - session_date
   - booking_date
   - student_id
   - coach_id
4. Avoid heavy joins in analytics (use snapshot table).
5. Partition future large tables (reports, bookings) by date.

---

# 5. OPTIONAL ANALYTICS TABLE

## student_skill_snapshots

Pre-aggregated monthly data:

- id
- student_id
- month
- year
- avg_forehand
- avg_backhand
- avg_serve
- avg_footwork
- avg_stamina
- attendance_rate
- growth_rate
- created_at

Purpose:
Fast dashboard analytics without heavy real-time calculation.
